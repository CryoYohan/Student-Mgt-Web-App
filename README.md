# Student-Mgt-Web-App
This Student Management Web Application, built using Python's Flask framework, allows users to securely register and log in, with password hashing for enhanced security. It integrates with a MySQL database to store and manage student records, providing features such as student registration, dynamic student list display, and validation for form inputs. The app uses bcrypt for password security, handles SQL queries dynamically, and provides real-time feedback to users. The project is managed through Git for version control, making it easy to track changes and improve functionality over time.
